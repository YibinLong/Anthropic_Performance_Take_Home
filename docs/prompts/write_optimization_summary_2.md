# NOTE: Written based on @4_optimization_summary.md

Great work. Create a markdown file And put it in the optimizations folder. Write the research that you did, the work that you did, and how you came to the conclusions that you did of how to get this better result. As well as the research ideas that you have.

Basically, in this markdown file report, you want to write it in a way so that an agentic LLM such as yourself will be able to read through it and know what optimizations you did, how you arrived at those conclusions, and the ideas that you have so that they can pick up the work in the future and further explore and try to get even better optimizations.
