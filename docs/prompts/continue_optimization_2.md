# Continue Optimization Prompt

I want to continue work on this project. Right now a lot of work was already done, However, we still need to work more on doing more optimizations. check out @docs/reports/optimizations/00_optimization_landscape.md and summaries at 8_optimization_summary.md and after for summaries on the improvements that we already did. What I want you to do is to think through any further implementations and optimizations we can do. Read through the implementation right now and really scrutinize every single part of the code. Look through the code and really scrutinize the code line by line. Every line counts. Where can we optimize it? We wanna eke out that much more performance. Use web search and do research on how we can improve this code further. Are there any research studies that we can use and implement that would work for the task?

After each optimization you try, run the entire test suite to see how many cycles you saved. Avoid any cycle regression. You can use the test suite as a sort of sanity check to check that you're going in the right direction, and to use that as a feedback loop.

Also, after reading the optimizations and what was tried before, try to think outside the box and find radical ways to save more cycles. Those could be used to speed the project up.
