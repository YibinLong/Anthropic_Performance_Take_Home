# Task Instructions

I want to continue work on this project. Look into IMPROVEMENTS_C.md. Plan out how you are going to implement task [NUMBER], and then implement ONLY that task. Gather any of the context you need, like from IMPROVEMENTS_A.md or IMPROVEMENTS_B.md. After that, run any of the tests (read running-tests.md to learn how) you need and then write a report document in markdown about what happened and how it worked out. Write it in a way so that agentic LLMs such as yourself will easily be able to read it and know what happened. Fix any issues that arise until the task is fully completed. Check off the task in IMPROVEMENTS_C.md when you're done with the task. Lets plan this out first!
