# Continue Optimization Prompt

Lets continue to work on this project. A lot of work has already been done. However, we still need to work more on doing more optimizations. Read @docs/reports/optimizations/00_optimization_landscape.md and 8_optimization_summary.md and the summaries after 8 using parallel subagents for summaries on the improvements that we already did. 

Use the available debugging tools to identify any existing inefficiencies. 

Use what was hypothesized before in the summaries, as well as use parallel sub-agents to web search to research possible optimizations on our code.

FORM A HYPOTHESIS on the optimization that is MOST LIKELY to be SUCCESSFUL.

Read through the implementation right now and scrutinize every single line of the code. Every line counts. Every speedup, no matter how small, counts. 

Implement the optimization based on the hypothesis. After the optimization you try, run the entire test suite to see how many cycles you saved. Avoid any regressions in the cycle counts.

After you're done, report back to me in the chat window about what happened and if there were any cycle improvements.
