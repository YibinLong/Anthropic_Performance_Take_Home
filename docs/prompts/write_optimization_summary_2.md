# NOTE: Written based on @4_optimization_summary.md

Great work. Create a markdown file and put it in the optimizations folder. Write down the work that you did, your thought process in getting there, the research that you did, and how you came to the conclusions that you did of how to get this better result. As well as the addition research ideas that you have.

Basically, in this markdown file report, you want to write it in a way so that an agentic LLM such as yourself will be able to read through it and know what optimizations you did, how you arrived at those conclusions, and the ideas that you have so that they can pick up the work in the future and further explore and try to get even better optimizations. Also mention any bugs or pitfalls that you ran into and then subsequently fix or possibly even was unable to fix.
