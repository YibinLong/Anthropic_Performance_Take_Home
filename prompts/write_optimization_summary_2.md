# NOTE: Written based on @4_optimization_summary.md

Great work. Create a markdown file and put it in the optimizations folder. Write down the optimizations that you did, your thought process in getting there, the research that you did, and how you came to the conclusions that you did to get this better result. 

Basically, in this markdown file report, you want to write it in a way so that a future agentic LLM such as yourself will be able to read through it and know what optimizations you did, how you arrived at those conclusions, and the ideas that you explored so that they can pick up the work in the future and further explore and try to get even better optimizations. Also mention any bugs or pitfalls that you ran into (if any, it's okay if there were none) and then if you were subsequently able OR unable to fix the issue.
