# Task Instructions

I want to continue work on this project. Look into IMPROVEMENTS_C.md. Plan out how you are going to implement task [NUMBER], and then implement ONLY that task. After that, run any of the tests (read running-tests.md to learn how) you need and then write a report document in markdown about what happened and how it worked out. Write it in a way so that agentic LLMs such as yourself will easily be able to read it and know what happened. Fix any issues that arise until the task is fully completed.
